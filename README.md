=============

A Town building simulator

Ever played an adictive online game where you build your kingdom or town and realized that it was taking too long to do anything unless you spent real money?   LeTownbuilder allows you to scrach that "building and managing" itch while not burdening you with microtransations, or massive hardware requirements.

Your town begins in a vacant, unsettled area.  Your start location is randomized and there are different possible biomes, so no 2 times you play are the same.  You start with 5 villagers.  Start by collecting resources and building houses and specialized buildings.  Villagers have moods, and can become happy or angry based many factors. Keep them fed, and housed.  Also make sure that there is a bonfire at night, or they will get cold.  You can increase happiness by always having food at lunchtime and by adding other advanced upgrades to your village(TBD)


Current villager types
============================
* normal,peasant - Your average villager comes in male female, or child verieties.  They are the average hard working villager with no bonus or penalty.

* child - The future of the settlement relies on these youngsters.  They dont work, and are an extra mouth to feed.

* bandits - Bandits are a mischivious breed who will attempt to steal food at lunchtime and other items(tbd)  They currently have no advantage but may later have advantages in hunting or assasinating unloved mayors.

* holymen - These preachers are not "affected" by general village unrest.  They don't particularly like dark elves.  They're firey sermons can provide a daily bonus to the general village morale.  However if the village morale drops too low, their sermons may have the opposite effect.

* werewolves - werewolves look like regular citizens until the sun goes down.  They then become vicious hunters and can kill villagers!  there is currenly no solution to handling werewolves, but (tbd) sheriff's will soon be able to deal with them.  Dark elves will also be able to handle them in a limited scope

* dark elves - the often misunderstood dark elf provides a massive bonus to research.  Having a dark elf, means free research without a school, and also allows you to research at a faster speed. However(tbd) dark elves are pyromaniacs and will randomly start fires.  They are also (TBD) the chief suspect besides the bandit who is responsible for the mayors untimely death.

* ghosts - ghosts are the departed who may be seen at night, if not burried in a graveyard...
